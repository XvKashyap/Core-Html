                    <P align="justify">Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate.</P>
                    <p align="justify">A good website is one that displays a careful balance between appearance and functionality. When our website is aesthetically pleasing but fails to offer the information or help your audience with what it looks for, the aesthetics cannot make up for the lack of functionality and vice versa. Therefore, web design comprises two broad key elements—aesthetic or visual elements and functional elements—that are of equal importance to make your website stand out.</p>
